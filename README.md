# 🚀 Employee Payroll & HR Management RESTful API

**🌟 Project Overview**
This is a production-ready Node.js/Express.js RESTful API designed to manage core Human Resources (HR) and Payroll functionalities. It features a secure, role-based access control (RBAC) architecture to govern access for Administrators, HR staff, and Employees. The API handles complex business logic, including automated payroll calculation and secure cloud storage.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Distinct workflows for Admin and Employee roles with secure JWT authentication (9999-day demo session).
* * **Efficient Data Management:** Server-side **Pagination** and **Regex Search** on the Employee list to handle large datasets.
* **Media Integration:** Profile picture management using **Multer** and **Cloudinary** for persistent image hosting.
* **Complex Analytics:** Advanced **MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines** to generate real-time payroll and attendance summaries.
* **Attendance Tracking:** Geo-fencing ready Punch-In/Out system with leave management logic.
